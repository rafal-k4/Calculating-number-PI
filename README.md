# Calculating Number &pi;

Calculation of &pi; in this project is proced using random generated numbers and relationship between field of a circle and a square. Knowing the fact that circle inscribed in square share the same length of diameter as the side of a square we can derive the formula of PI number which is:


![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cpi%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B4*%5Cdisplaystyle%20P_%7Bcircle%7D%7D%7B%5Cdisplaystyle%20P_%7Bsquare%7D%7D)  

In this program P<sub>circle</sub> and P<sub>square</sub> are the number of dots that are randomly placed either in circle field or square field.

Accuracy of calculated &pi; number strictly depends on randomness of the generated random numbers
